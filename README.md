# story-flow-blue

Update for the business website for a film & TV director to incorporate a flow similar to 'https://no.auk.eco' with a classic blue style. The website should now focus on a clean, modern design that emphasizes storytelling and innovation, similar to the referenced site. Incorporate a minimalist design with smooth transitions, high-quality images, and interactive elements. The color scheme should be based around classic blue, reflecting professionalism and creativity. The website should still include sections for an about page, portfolio, contact form, and a blog for updates, but with a layout and design inspired by the no.auk.eco website's flow and aesthetic.
